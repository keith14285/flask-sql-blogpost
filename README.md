The purpose of this project was to learn specifically about the flask module in Python, and how SQL can be used in a practical manner to set up a fully functional website, which allows users to register, log in, post and edit their own blogposts.

Much of this has been obtained with the help of an online tutorial that I was following, but I am in the process of trying to add my own features to this page.
